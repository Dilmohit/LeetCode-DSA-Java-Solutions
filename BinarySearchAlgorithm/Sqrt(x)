Question - 

Given a non-negative integer x, compute and return the square root of x.
Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated, and only the integer part of the result is returned.
Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in exponent function or operator, such as pow(x, 0.5) or x ** 0.5.

Answer -

class Solution {
    public static int mySqrt(int x) {

        if(x == 0) return 0;

        int left = 1, right = x;

        while(left <= right){
            int mid = left + (right-left)/2;

            // check if we found out the perfect square
            if(mid == x/mid){
                return mid;
            }

            // if the mid is large for our square, then reduce the right value
            else if(mid > x/mid){
                right = mid - 1;
            }

            // else increase the left value
            else{
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }

        // if no answer found till this point, then definitely the right will be the answer
        return right;
    }
}
